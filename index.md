Hosting your files is something that should be taken seriously. You can store
and share your data with confidence using [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org/).
ownCloud is a personal cloud collaboration platform that lets you store files in
one location and share them with others around the world. For more information
on ownCloud, visit its
